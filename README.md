# Velociraptor-Incident-Response-Project

End-to-end endpoint incident response project using Velociraptor for detection, containment, and forensic artifact collection.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **endpoint incident response workflow** using **Velociraptor**, an open-source Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) platform.

The objective is to simulate a realistic security investigation by deploying Velociraptor, enrolling a Windows endpoint, detecting suspicious activity, quarantining the endpoint, and collecting forensic artifacts for analysis.

This repository is intended as a **hands-on DFIR showcase project** for SOC, Blue Team, and Incident Response roles.
